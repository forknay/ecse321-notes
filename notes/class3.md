# Chapter 3 : Agile Software Development

* Last time: Plan-driven development
- Activities all planned in advance
- Progress measured against plan

However, businesses operate in a constantly changing environment.
- Requirements are always changing!
- It is impossible to derive a complete set of requirements @ beginning of a project
- As a requirements change, design also must change!

Moreover, businesses want to develop and deliver software quickly.

*Agile methods* are designed to release software quickly.
(Type of software process)

All agile methods share 3 common characteristics.

1. Specification, design, implementation are *interleaved*.
- Design documentation is minimized (expensive)
2. System is developed incrementally.
