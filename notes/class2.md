# Chapter 2

**Types of SW processes**

- plan driven: most activities are planned ahead of time, program measured against plan
- agile: planning is incremental and iterative, program measured against working software

## 2.1 Software process models

Simplified representations of a software process, presented from a specific perspective.

### 2.1.1 The waterfall model

- linear sequential flow
- phases: requirement specifications, system design, implementation and testing, integration testing, operation and maintenance
- pros:
  - good for small-scale projects with few people
  - when rigidity of requirements is needed (e.g., safety-critical systems, embedded systems)
- cons:
  - inflexible partitioning of the project into distinct stages
  - difficult to accommodate evolving requirements
  - little customer involvement

### 2.1.2 Incremental development

1. develop an initial version
2. get feedback from users
3. refine the software through several versions

- pros:
  - easy to adapt to changing customer requirements
  - early deployment
- cons:
  - costly because tons of steps
  - budget unknown in advance
  - no long-term plan
  - small changes lead to messy code

### 2.1.3 Agile development

- easy to change requirements
- easy to deploy early
- scrum: popular agile method
  - roles: product owner, scrum master, development team
  - task lists with estimated times
  - tasks are divided in sprints (2 weeks) and epics (months)
